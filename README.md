## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Greg


Hi, Iâ€™m Gregory Rogers â€” a data enthusiast with a knack for turning numbers into insights. With skills in SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and advanced spreadsheets, I love uncovering patterns and building dashboards that make data easy to understand. My background in business development and freight management taught me how to solve problems and communicate clearly â€” now I apply that same approach to analytics.
